      <description>Hi, My name is Bruno Gabriel Lebtag Lebtag. I am a Brazilian Computer Scientist and Light Novelist. I am also a fluent English speaker. I started coding with 16 years and since then I couldn&amp;rsquo;t stop anymore. I love what I do and I can&amp;rsquo;t picture myself being or doing anything else.
I consider myself a polyglot and polymath. I am currently learning german (although I can&amp;rsquo;t speak yet) and I&amp;rsquo;m also taking a Master&amp;rsquo;s in Software Architecture.</description>
