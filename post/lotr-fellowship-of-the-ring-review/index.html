<h1 id="disclaimer">Disclaimer</h1>

<p>First of all, by NO means I am a &ldquo;specialist&rdquo; on the topic and I am NOT evaluating the book as a specialist would do. Here is only my humble opinion that is based on my personal preferences and because of that it may diverge from yours. So no hard feelings, OK?</p>

<p>So let&rsquo;s get back to business!</p>

<h1 id="background">Background</h1>

<p><em>The Fellowship of The Ring</em> was released in June 29, 1954. It had 423 pages in its first edition and it is the first volume of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings">The Lord of Ring</a> books trilogy written by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._R._R._Tolkien">J.R.R. Tolkien</a>. It was translated into around 50 languages and sold around 150 million copies worldwide. The book is a continuation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hobbit">The Hobbit</a>, which is a children&rsquo;s fantasy novel published 17 years before <em>The Fellowship of The Ring</em>.</p>

<p>The book expands the universe presented in <em>The Hobbit</em> by picking up the story of the ring found by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilbo_Baggins">Bilbo Baggins</a> in a cave after a battle of wits with a strange creature named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gollum">Gollum</a> and how he has now to bestow the ring to his young cousin, Frodo, so he can destroy it in a hot sauna in Mount Doom. In 2001, it received a four Oscar adaptation (Best Makeup and Hairstyling, Best Costume Design, Best Cinematography and Best Original Score) by Peter Jackson. If you haven&rsquo;t watched it, go watch it! But first, read the book. It may screw up your experience (more below).</p>

<h1 id="the-book">The Book</h1>

<p>Well, my book was a 2002 Brazilian Portuguese translation by the Martins Fontes publishing house. I didn&rsquo;t want to buy an english version (thank God, cuz it would cost a lot!), so no rolling eyes please. Bear with me bro! The book is very beaten up but it was just fine, ok?!</p>

<h1 id="my-opinion">My Opinion</h1>

<p>Throughout my youth, I spent my time playing video games or watching movies or reading programming technical books. I never had read a fantasy book before (or any other kind). One day, a friend of mine presented my doom: <strong>Anime</strong>. Yes, please don&rsquo;t judge me!</p>

<p>And to make things worst, it was (like any other boy around my age) <strong>Naruto</strong>.</p>

<p>I went head-on in the world of anime. I watched a lot of <del>shitting</del> low quality anime and read a lot of manga too. But, before I noticed, I started to realize I really love stories and more than that, I want to write my own stories. Who would&rsquo;ve imagined it would all start with Naruto, right?</p>

<p>But, how can I became a writer if I never read a book before?</p>

<p><em>That can not do!</em></p>

<p>I packed my stuff and chose to go bold! I decided to start with <strong>The Lord of the Ring trilogy</strong>. Many people was against it because they said it was too descriptive. But I was confident I could handle it because NOW I was determined to learn how to write. Who best professor than Tolkien?</p>

<p>But boy, they were right!</p>

<p>I mean, it was not bad. In fact, far from it. I enjoyed it a lot and I missed a lot when I finished the first book (it took me a while to start the second book). Buuuuut there were a lot of mountains! A lot! (and hills! and trees!)</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t remember exactly but the characters spent the whole book going up and down hills, mountains, trees, etc. I was talking to my brother who&rsquo;s a Tolkien fan and he told me that it was the author&rsquo;s intention to make you feel this. The author seemed to enjoyed this type of activity and wanted to make his readers feel the sensation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountaineering">Mountaineering</a>. It is really a intense journey and for me it took a lot of the pleasure of reading the book but I still enjoyed it nevertheless.</p>

<p>Another important thing I noticed was that I was in a rush to get to the scenes I remembered from the movie. So I can say it screwed up my experience a little. It&rsquo;s better to read the book first and than watching the movie. Maybe I would be calmer climbing mountains (dunno, probably not). I guess I am an impatient reader. I love fast-pace actions and emotional stories (sorry, anime again).</p>

<p>The best part for me was the end (no, seriously!). The last story when Frodo is assaulted by Boromir it is perfect. How the author delivers the scene is fantastic. I really enjoyed his description and how the events unfolded was excellent. I really enjoy emotional stories (already mentioned) so that part for me was the best. I also love the story when they were in the mines of Moria and they fight against the Balrog.</p>

<p>It was not so interesting the elvies, Tom bombadil, Rivendell and the Lothlórien part. Tolkien tries to show the elvies as some form of out-of-the-world creatures and it doesn&rsquo;t connect with me. No, it was not because they were white supremacists (although they are!). It just seemed forced to my taste (I like anime, so who cares about my taste anyway).</p>

<p>The soft magic system was also confusing. It is not clear what each magic character can do. How powerfull is Gandalf? How powerfull is Saruman? How powerfull are the elvies? Who knows! Maybe I&rsquo;ll have to keep reading more to know (the extras? dunno!)</p>

<p>But the most important question: Why can&rsquo;t I use the ring? Well I guess I am starting to be tempted&hellip;.my little&hellip; precious!</p>
