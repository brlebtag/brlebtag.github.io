<h1 id="disclaimer">Disclaimer</h1>

<p>First of all, by NO means I am a &ldquo;specialist&rdquo; on the topic and I am NOT evaluating the book as a specialist would do. Here is only my humble opinion that is based on my personal preferences and because of that it may diverge from yours. So no hard feelings, OK?</p>

<p>So let&rsquo;s get back to business!</p>

<h1 id="background">Background</h1>

<p>According to wikipedia, this book was first published in 1979 and it was written by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syd_Field">Syd Field</a>. The book is simply considered the bible of screenwriting by many. Also according to the author, some of his previous students were <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judd_Apatow">Judd Apatow</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Singleton">John Singleton</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Hamilton_Phelan">Anna Hamilton Phelan</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfonso_Cuar%C3%B3n">Alfonso Cuar√≥n</a> and other &ldquo;indirect students&rdquo; like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Cameron">James Cameron</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Darabont">Frank Darabont</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tina_Fey">Tina Fey</a>.</p>

<p>He is The Man, The Myth, The Legend of screenwriting and his book serves as 101 textbook for screenwriting class. His Screenwriting paradigm is followed by many and when it is not, well, they usually don&rsquo;t go well on theaters. Many professional writers (not only screenwriters) recommend reading this book and that&rsquo;s why I decided to take my time to read the book.</p>

<h1 id="the-book">The Book</h1>

<p>\o/, This time I bought the book! and it was from <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Screenplay-Foundations-Screenwriting-Syd-Field-ebook/dp/B000S1LAYG">amazon</a>. It took a few days to deliver to Brazil but it is fine.</p>

<p><img src="/img/screenplay-book.jpg" alt="Screenplay: The Foundations of Screenwriting" /></p>

<p>Well, My first impression from the book was mixed. I was expecting something more resistant but the book is quite fragile.</p>

<p><img src="/img/screenplay-open.jpg" alt="Screenplay: The Foundations of Screenwriting but opened" /></p>

<p>Anyway, it is my kid and as I good father, I don&rsquo;t look at appearance but content and boy <strong>it has content!</strong></p>

<h1 id="my-opinion">My Opinion</h1>

<p>Once upon a time, My brother woke up a day and decided he wanted to write a book. A fictional book. He spent almost three years writing his book and when he finally finished his book he couldn&rsquo;t publish it. He registered his book anyway and end of the story. For him, he was not interested in becoming a writer anyway, it was more adolescent thing than anything else. But as you start entering this world of writing, you see many people taking the same path.</p>

<p>As Lindsay Ellis once <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuRE55YH8yE">said</a>, publishing a book is not a easy feat, not even if you are a famous youtuber like her! And in the same video, she also mentioned you need to have your book finished before you try selling it in the first place. But if you&rsquo;re like me, a <strong>total amateur</strong>, what confidence do you have about your own skills? Not only that, I intent to publish in english and I am not even a native speaker!</p>

<p>You may be wondering now: <strong>Why don&rsquo;t you try publishing in portuguese in the first place? You are a Brazilian!</strong></p>

<p>Well, it turns out that correct portuguese is a tough task. In fact, it is easier for me to write perfect english than it is to write perfect portuguese. During my high school time I didn&rsquo;t care about portuguese at all. Irony, now I really want to learn portuguese. I am taking my time to learn portuguese but it is really tough.</p>

<p>Anyway, back to the point. As a Computer Scientist with <a href="https://www.scrum.org/">Scrum</a> and <a href="https://agilemanifesto.org/">Agile methodology</a> experience, spending three years writing a book to discover in the end the book is trash is <strong>unacceptable</strong>. So I decided to take a different approach. I decided to learn as much as possible from good material such as <strong>screenplay</strong> and try to write as many stories as possible so I can gain some experience real quickly.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel">Romances and Novels</a> sometimes can take time because they have many details you must make right. So I decided to go for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_story">short stories</a>. In fact, Many authors like Neil Gaiman took this path too. It allows you to gain a good amount of experience and it also allows you to gain feedback very soon by having something to show others of your work. It is the perfect strategy. So if you ever want to go to this world, <strong>Take this path!</strong> It is the easiest one and it will definetely produce results fast. Or at least you will discover you don&rsquo;t have the gift for this faster (what? It may happen, I am just saying).</p>

<p>And now, finally about the book.</p>

<p>In one word: PERFECT!</p>

<p>The End!</p>

<p>Just kidding!</p>

<p>I learned so much that it is really hard to described everything in words. In fact, I really need to read it again so I can absorbed more information this time. Anyway I&rsquo;ll try to name a few things.</p>

<h2 id="plot">Plot</h2>

<p>Syd Field&rsquo;s paradigm of three acts is really awesome and at the same time very obvious. So obvious that many people misses the point. Altough, he is teaching a screenplay&rsquo;s structure, all stories can benefit from this paradigm. Some stories seems to have no begin or end at all and when you read or watch them it fells simply weird, like something is missing.</p>

<p>Another important thing he emphasizes is the importance of the dramatic premise of the story. The main ingredient of all stories are two elements: <strong>problems</strong> and <strong>people</strong>. If you don&rsquo;t have this two elements you don&rsquo;t have a story. As simple as that. You have to create some form of conflict otherwise your story will be boring!!! Problems are like seasoning for your story. Without them your story will be tasteless. It doesn&rsquo;t have to be aliens trying to destroy the earth (although it can be) but it just have to be some kind of problem like the protagonist&rsquo;s love interest is in love someone else (soooo cliche).</p>

<h2 id="character-development">Character development</h2>

<p>I really love his techniques for character development. Creating a bibliography for your characters can help you organize your ideas and make the characters more credible. Another interesting technique is character interview, although I am not sure if I read it in the book or in some blog on the internet but it is a valid technique to use.</p>

<p>One thing I am sure came from the book was Syd Field&rsquo;s insistence for you, the writer, to know your characters. As the author said, if you don&rsquo;t know your characters who will? So it is really for you as a writer to know your characters and their background, fears, emotions, etc. Anything that defines them the way they are.</p>

<h2 id="structuring-your-story">Structuring your story</h2>

<p>The real reason why I bought this book was to learn the <strong>basic vocabulary</strong> used by writers and their <strong>techniques</strong>. One thing I though was really hard to do was how to structure your story. The book teaches us to structure your story in sequences and scenes which is a very convient way to structure the story. The ideas of <strong>plot points</strong>, <strong>key incident</strong>, <strong>incite incident</strong> is really awesome! It makes really easy to organize your story.</p>

<p>One idea I really love was <strong>scene cards</strong>. It makes things really easy to organize your thoughts. It offers you a high degree of freedom in the writing process.</p>

<p><img src="/img/scene-cards.jpg" alt="Scene cards" /></p>

<p>They make me remember Kanban cards, So I really enjoyed!</p>

<p>Anyway, for me the book totally worthed the invested money. I learned a lot and I am already using everthing I learned from the book. <strong>So I totally recommend the book!</strong></p>
